## Hey! 
Welcome to my GitHub profile which examples some of my personal data analysis projects. I'm currently a Senior Financial Analyst at Effectv which is the advertising arm for Comcast's market retail linear & digital business. My team is tied to 2 of our 6 major regions, and works closely with the sales leaders within these regions. Think weekly reports (Boring but necessary!) and ad-hoc analysis (The fun stuff!) that brings actionable insights to drive revenue. I can label the data I work with as Revenue/CRM/Pipeline. Knowing this data from top to bottom and how to join and drill into these varied datasets is what I do. 

My workplace has me working heavily in Excel with some use of Power BI / Tableau / Looker (Comcast is big and different departments leverage different data viz). While not required of the role, I utilize Python for analysis via Time Series, Regression, Feature Performance/Random Forest. Mostly when I try to identify what KPIs are a predictor for driving account executive future success (hitting budget for the year, etc). 

Now to my projects, I am showing a combination of things similar to what I do within my current role, and experimentation that I simply find interesting and hope to continually improve upon. 

Though you should already have my email if you're reading this, feel welcome to email me at roryrodgers2@gmail.com with any questions.
